It's a Minecraft mod.

This mod adds some alloys into the game. A block called "Alloyer" is used to make melted alloy buckets.

Code is generated by MCreator (https://mcreator.net/). The code is under the GPLv3.0 license.

The binaryies can be found in CurseForge (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bronze-industry). Alpha versions will not be uploaded until there is a later beta version.

Note that the source code may not be the latest code. I'll update the code when a "beta1" release is published. Otherwise, I'll upload a zip file containing the source code regularly.
